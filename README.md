# React-URL-Shortener

## https://nevin.cc (for now, until I rewrite the website)

![Image of website]("/images/1.png")

Made by: https://github.com/Nevin1901

A simple URL shortener built in react and using express as the backend. I mainly made it as a way for me to learn React JS and how to actually use express.

## Running it

Client

```
cd client/frontend
npm i
npm start OR npm run build and serve -l
```

Server

```
cd server
npm i
node index
```

## TODO

Nothing for now
